    <h2><span class="subt1">Captain Sovlin,</span>  <br />
        <span class="subt2">United Nations Fleet Command</span>
    </h2>
    <h3>Date [standardized human time]:<br /> November 27, 2136</h3>
    <p>The Federation ambush fleet moseyed forward, with a faint semblance of strategy. The enemy were sticking in groups of four, so that the predators couldn't pick off lone vessels with their superior wit. Our opponents were also coordinating attacks on targets, aiming to gun down hapless humans with deadly crossfires. A standard UN vessel would be ripped apart from both sides before they knew what hit them.</p>

    <p>The leading Terran ships had their shields obliterated in a few seconds; the plasma onslaught decimated exposed hulls. Any ordinary species would choose a desperate retreat, and regroup in an advantageous location. But instead, there was an icy calm across the bridge, at least, from the human crew. The Fissan on comms was whinnying in terror, the Venlil advisors were crying, and the Yotul at my station...was doing his job without issue. That was a surprise.</p>

    <p>"Deploying tactical drones. Stay on the move!" a predatory voice on the radio barked.</p>

    <p>The spacecraft carriers had a limited supply of autonomous craft, which were a Terran novelty. Unfortunately, most "drones" were lost during the defense of Earth; restocking the reserves was a challenge, with the manufacturing delays. Since humans were the only ones who possessed the innovation, and weren't keen on giving away their secrets, their newfound allies couldn't help on that front.</p>

    <p>The predators trust no one, not truly. I can't say I blame them.</p>

    <p>But even the few dozen drones we had at our disposal were a useful tool. They could undertake the riskiest maneuvers, without any concern for life and limb. The enemy was likely blindsided by the unmanned vessels, so they weren't equipped to deal with them. Manual targeting was a requisite, because the automatons were much smaller than standard ships.</p>

    <p>The drones twirled through the sky, changing direction on a dime. There was no worrying about whether inertial dampeners could keep up, with no crew aboard. Pinning down the nimble craft proved a challenge for prey operators, in real time. The Federation lobbed plasma at the inbound contacts, but the unmanned vehicles simply veered off at ninety-degree angles. The enemy hesitated, uncertain how to proceed.</p>

    <p>Captain Monahan nodded to the weapons station. "Ready our armor-piercing missiles. Wait for the drones to land a few punches, and fire."</p>

    <p>Our spacecraft cruised ahead, falling in beside two lightweight gunships that appeared to be Tilfish impounds. The Terrans had outfitted the seized vessels with kinetic turrets on the hull. I wasn't sure what impact that weaponry would have against shields. The humans should know efficacy was why plasma dominated space, despite the higher energy demands.</p>

    <p>The drones coasted onward, anticipating Federation blows through predictive abilities. Perhaps the humans programmed algorithms to monitor power output and radio chatter. These robotic creations were a marvel of engineering, regardless. Whatever anyone said about the predators, nobody could doubt their wicked intelligence.</p>

    <p>Our handful of automated craft flew circles around the larger forces, drawing within striking distance. The craft swooped in across the Federation's front lines, and unloaded missiles from close range. Detonations buffeted the metal exteriors, crippling shields. With inhuman response time, the drones transitioned to a deluge of kinetics and mini-missiles.</p>

    <p>"Hey, Gojid. Find us some targets," Tyler snarled.</p>

    <p>I monitored the sensor data, finding the ship groupings with the most sustained damage. The Federation army was hurling munitions at the drones in a blind frenzy; the enemy hoped the deluge would cut off escape. Brute force proved enough to whittle down our unmanned charge, by a significant margin. We had just a few seconds to capitalize on the discombobulation.</p>

    <p>Scanning the readout, my eyes turned to a Federation bunch just out of range. This enemy squadron had lost a ship to the drones already, judging by the hefty debris. The remaining trio were slowed by an aged bomber with an inefficient drive signature; that meant they couldn't pull off sudden movements. A lack of evasive abilities offered an easy mark for the humans.</p>

    <p>I highlighted those three ships on the map. "There. You take out the faster escorts with a one-two punch, then that bomber is sitting prey."</p>

    <p>"Good call. We're saving the weapons station a lot of guesswork," Tyler responded.</p>

    <p>The sensors officer passed along the information, before turning back to me. There was a gleam of interest in his eyes, which was something I didn't want to encourage. Perhaps I was doing a little too well with my orders, for an alien?</p>
