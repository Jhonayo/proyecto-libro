Memory Transcription Subject: Tassi, Bissem Alien Liaison

Date [standardized human time]: July 20, 2160

When the Sapient Coalition first arrived, I placed them on a pedestal, thinking they were beyond Bissems—with infallible technology and the ability to make anyone bend to their will if they desired. 

Now, after the battle seven days’ travel outside their border, I saw them for what they were: people scrambling to find answers against a superior force, and trying to rally support. They were in the same boat as Ivrana, as we did what was necessary and turned to anyone who’d lend a claw. I didn’t know how the humans would react from their station, when the Arxur ships Kaisal had hidden in a nearby system were moved to Ivrana. They might put two and two together when the Collective vessels burst onto the scene by the Osirs’ world—which the Terrans called Apep—and declared their quarantine to be over. Bissems could receive tremendous blowback for that political move, especially depending on how the reptilians treated the herbivores.

That was Naltor’s domain to grapple with, however. My job was to offer aid to the galaxy in non-military ways, gathering support and goodwill for Ivrana. I’d noticed that the Paltan government was unwilling to provide sanctuary to the Grand Herd, due to how little they’d shared the load of those fleeing the Arxur’s forever war. Ivrana had an entire continent we weren’t using, Nelmin: claimed by no country since the first Global War. When I voiced the idea of taking Sivkit refugees, the Lassian government loved the optics of showing that we could co-exist with aliens and share what we had. I found myself sent off on a long shuttle ride to the inside edge of Paltan space, thankfully away from the front lines.

Loxsel accepted my invitation for a parlay only after I told him I was on my way to meet him in person. “It seems I have no choice!” Those were his words, so I’m not sure if this isn’t all a colossal waste of my time.

The human-Paltan military base had an artificial atmosphere inside its premises, sealed in a sprawling dome that stretched for miles. The Terrans towered over the fluffy yellow aliens, whose heads came about to where humans’ hands stretched down. There wasn’t much fear shown as the two walked side by side, but I noticed the simians taking special care to watch where they were stepping; their narrow gaze turned downward, rather than directly ahead of them. It was subtle behavior shifts to accommodate other species that showed the Earthlings’ compassion.

“Tassi?” a human voice called, as I exited my shuttle on the dock for civilian guests. “If you’re looking for Ambassador Loxsel, he’s in the visitors’ inn straight to your left. Hard to miss—that one sticks out like a sore thumb.”

I chuckled. “Humans love expressions about hands the way we do flippers. There’s some overlap even.”

“It’s what we use to interact with the world. Kinda important if you ask me. Let me know if there’s anything at all you need; we set up a place for you to stay, unless you really want to do a 180 and book it back home.”

“I wouldn’t mind talking to the Paltans about helping out with any refugees that are straining their system, if that’s still an issue. For now, my first and only priority is meeting Loxsel.”

“Yeah, good luck with that.”

The soldier stepped aside, waving a palm toward the module that had basic amenities and a decent bit of sprucing up. While it was an artificial habitat in the middle of space, the garden the Terrans had planted was quite real—and seemed to have a major pest problem. I could see that entire rows of crops had been devoured, and bushes had nibbles in their leaves. How had the humans smuggled animals like that onto a military base, without noticing? Perhaps they needed to spray them with some pesticides to fend off the offending creature. I knocked on the door, waiting for the Sivkit, but there was no response.

Where is Loxsel? Our dramatic ambassador is nowhere to be seen, but I spy, through the window, the setup he calls into the SC from.

I noticed dirt strewn across the path, and on closer inspection, spotted fresh Sivkit-shaped footprints carving a path through the decimated plants. Loxsel might’ve gone to investigate the animal; given his skittish nature, he probably needed backup. As I’d been told by my friends, the Federation didn’t understand that wild critters with side-facing eyes could be dangerous. I wasn’t a fighter, but since he collapsed on the floor when the SC lost, I couldn’t see him having much resilience. Taking inventory of anything that could be used as a weapon. I crept around toward the back of the inn. If avoidable, I didn’t want to leap to violence in front of him, and get dubbed a “vicious predator.”

That was when I spotted a tail with a plume of gray fur at the tip, sticking out of a thick hedge. My immediate reaction was disbelief, as I saw Ambassador Loxsel waist deep in the vegetation; the Sivkit was devouring it from the inside out, judging by the crackling sounds. He was the pest problem that had ravaged this garden? I found him much more “voracious” than the humans, if he’d “graze” on plants in spite of other options. Unsure how to react, I made a few clicking noises to get his attention. Loxsel pulled himself free, leaves and twigs caked near his mouth. 

“I am cornered by another predator, after being left to chew only these acerbic fronds! My tail, a morsel for you to masticate, like those fish your beak cleaves and ruptures,” the Sivkit brayed. “The humans served me right to you. Why? WHY?! I have given them nothing but adulation for their hunting prowess!”

I took a step back, alarmed by his wild accusations. “It’s Tassi, the Bissem you agreed to speak with; I just want to talk, Loxsel. Like you pointed out, we eat fish, not land creatures. I came here to talk about how we can bring the Grand Herd to safety, away from here; Ivrana has a continent that we’re not using, so you’d hardly have to see us. You need somewhere to go that’s far from the war’s epicenter.”

“And from the humans! Don’t let their act of affability fool you. When that s-soldier, right there, didn’t know I was listening, it said it was so hungry it could ‘eat a horse.’ I looked it up—that’s a big prey animal. Its stomach made growling noises.  My time is running out…but the Grand Herd could walk itself to a different c-cattle pen. Yours!”

“You’re not anyone’s cattle on Ivrana. Bissems are very different from other predators. Remember, we only eat fish. Are you a fish?”

“You can’t tell?! I knew you weren’t really that picky. No carnivore is; what’s one carcass versus any other? It quenches the bloodlust just the same. Anything is a f-fish if you’re hungry enough, so yes, I guess I am. Despondent, I am! Skewer me and be t-through with it!”

“What you’re saying is crazy. I don’t know why you’re twisting my words, but I was trying to drill home the point that you’re not a fish. The humans have been nothing but polite to you.”

“They surrounded me with guns!” Loxsel shrieked. “T-thousands upon thousands of ships…maybe millions to watch me, c-cut off any hope of escape. We went to the strongest predators and gave ourselves up as an offering, and what have we to show for it? NOTHING! They lost, failed…were vanquished by that desecrated world!”

I folded my flippers, trying to discover if there was any sense in the Sivkits’ words. “Why do you say it’s desecrated? You haven’t even seen what’s going on down on the surface. There’s no reason you should be this upset. It’s a random planet.”

“No, it’s not! It is that which was burned and stolen…hidden from our sight by the spine snappers. A home s-said to be lost, but obfuscated through willful, execrable intent. History books must be emended, splashed with light as we reclaim the olden hearth. Where is the justice? There is no mercy for Sivkits. We are fettered, tarnished…braised and beholden to carnivore masters, for all time!”

“I don’t understand what you’re saying. It’d help if you spoke in normal terms.”

“This is normal. Don’t question my normalcy; I am FINE! I said I’m fine, Tassi, you feral slurper of fish guts! I am no Sivkit-brain. Loxsel is an orator of breathtaking erudition, and lo, you are not cultured enough to appreciate my mastery!”

I turned away from the Sivkit ambassador, flustered by his “erudition.” It might take a moment to parse what he had meant, but a burned and stolen home, said to be lost…hm. Spine snappers meant the Federation, and Loxsel knew that much, regardless of him attributing that atrocity to the humans in front of the SC. Tied together, it sounded a lot like the story Dustin told: of exterminators destroying the Sivkit homeworld and their deeds being covered up, under the absurd guise that Sivkits somehow misplaced their native planet. Did he mean that this desert planet was their lost origin world, Tinsas? That would explain why they were so set on an infertile, barren sphere—it wasn’t a random planet.

“It wasn’t about grazing, or trying to get away from the Federation’s old territory,” I ventured. “You found Tinsas.”

Loxsel took a sliding step toward me, gazing at the stars above the dome. “We went out looking for our beloved. Beloved Tinsas: the womb of our species, beautiful as any cosmological finds; sheltering as checkered shade in—” 

“A yes or no will suffice.”

“Hmph. Yes.”

“And now another species has taken up residence there.”

“Descretation! Thieves, assailants, and bloodlusters, of a caliber never seen. They must die! The humans had a chance, with the bombs, but didn’t pounce.”

“I think the humans would rather try to talk than bomb a species to extinction, Loxsel. That isn’t something you do lightly. Sivkits haven’t been there for almost a thousand years, so the world was empty when this species came.”

“Empty? TAKEN FROM US! We did try to talk—they murdered countless, priceless heads of cattle instead. That says, ‘this is ours now,’ and they won’t give it back. If the humans were genuine in their offer to help us, they wouldn’t temper their wrath. They’d purge the putrid scum from our planet!”

I took a few steps back, as Loxsel moved close enough that I could feel his breath. “It’s not fair to expect them to know. You haven’t told the humans why you want this planet.”

“We do not trust them. They exploded our last ambassador, while she hid powerless in a trash can, begging for her life. No exaggeration. That is me next, fulminated into pieces and pieces—like their drones. We hoped the humans would do to Tinsas what they did for Ambassador Axsely, but nooo! Of course they don’t!”

“I have no clue what you’re talking about, again, but…just because someone got ‘exploded’ back then, doesn’t mean anyone needs to now? Or that that’s normal human behavior?”

“How can we trust the Terran predators, when we can’t even trust them to be consistent in bombing innocent people? This is a travesty! An outrage!”

“This is the last I’ll say of this, but you asked for their help. Give them all the facts. What else can you ‘sacrifice?’ Don’t you want it to be worth it?”

Loxsel fell back on his haunches. “You finally said something that made sense, Tassi. Well done. I’ll consider telling the infinite-walkers about Tinsas, if it’ll make our transaction worthwhile. It’s not as if the gates of the cattle pen haven’t already sealed behind me—and I don’t want the information tortured out of me!”

“Might as well just tell them now.”

“I’ll show them. I’m good prey, meek prey! I’ve only been accused of predator disease twice…in the last year. That’s it! A record low!”

While I didn’t agree with calling all mental illness “predator disease,” nor with the Federation’s heartless treatment options, the ambassador could definitely be diagnosed with something. The conversation with Loxsel was becoming more exasperating by the second, so I decided to try to steer him back on course. My mission was to have the Grand Herd stop off on our forbidden continent; Bissems taking in refugees would show our good nature. I intended to pass on the information about Tinsas to the United Nations, as soon as I finished this discussion; I didn’t trust the Sivkit not to have a mood swing that stopped him from spilling the fish bait. This would also show Bissems’ value to humanity, and the rest of the SC.

When they’re fighting a war because of the Sivkits’ expedition, it’s important that they have the facts. I’m sure the humans will be curious to know how the Grand Herd found that out…and that the Federation ventured much further than we thought.

“What do you say about sending refugees to Ivrana? The Sivkits shouldn’t venture outward with dangerous species out there,” I tested. “The Grand Herd needs a world to go where you know the risks, right?”

Loxsel tipped over while sitting down, a stricken look on his face. “Fine! We must hope humans wouldn’t steal cattle from another p-predator—and that we stay a second-best option compared to fish. I submit, Tassi! Send the coordinates, and I’ll ferry the expeditions to their doom!”

“I’ll send the coordinates now. You can gather the expedition ships who want a safe haven, and they can follow me back to Ivrana. Can you do that, Loxsel?”

“I’ll go back inside my prison…s-send the message now. Bissems, oh sinister ones, you will have your catch ready by tomorrow; it will be so, as you have decreed!”

“Good. Thanks for your time. I hope for a safe and quiet voyage back to Ivrana, leading your refugees to a place they won’t have to worry.”

“Very well. So long.” The Sivkit wailed as soon as I began walking away, though I didn’t let myself turn back; I wanted his voice to fade into the distance. “What have I agreed to? What have I done? Sentenced to life with carnivores, oh cursed fate: worse than death. Languishing, and wishing I were slain! Let me grieve in peace! Leave me be!”

I hurried out of the decimated garden, hoping that the Grand Herd wouldn’t be as high-maintenance as this fellow. The important aspect was securing allies for Ivrana, and making a statement to the galaxy about who we were; bringing the Sivkits to our world would play well with the Sapient Coalition—at least, the herbivores who were unsettled by us. In a way, this was pre-emptive damage control in case our coziness with the Arxur got out. I turned back toward the enlisted humans who’d pointed me toward the inn; he smirked as I approached him, seeing the story of Loxsel told in my eyes.

“Any luck with the funny bunny?” the Terran chuckled.

Confusion overtook my features. “What?”

“Never mind. Is there something I can help you with, Tassi?”

“I need to speak with the United Nations; preferably someone high up. You’re going to want to hear this…I think the entire Sapient Coalition might.”

He flashed his teeth. “I’m going to need more than that to summon the brass on short notice. What is this about? What did Loxsel say?”

“Well, I can’t substantiate that it’s true, but Loxsel seemed to imply that the planet they were attacked nearby? It’s their old homeworld, Tinsas. The Sivkits are so bent out of shape, I think, because they want it back.”

The alien whistled, stroking his stubbly chin with nimble digits. “You don’t say. That’s a claim our intelligence agencies will have to follow up on, and it’s well beyond my paygrade. I mean, shit, that’s Project Chronicle territory. I’ll pass a message up the chain of command. And don’t worry, I’ll make sure they know who it came from.”

“Am I that transparent?”

“Nothing wrong with that. Every new species wants to prove themself, but I hope you don’t feel like you have to. We’ve got your back, no matter how it all shakes out.”

“Humans do, sure. It’s the other 81 parties in your Coalition that we’re worried about.”

“Fair enough. They warm a bit slow to predators, but we’re proof they come around eventually. Give it time, and don’t take it personal.”

“Easier said than done. We just want to help, and make a good impression. I hope knowing the Tinsas tidbit makes a difference.”

“I hope so too. It almost always helps to have all the facts, so thanks for letting us know. Your lodge is on the opposite side from Loxsel, if you want to settle down for the day. You earned a good rest, on us.”

“Thank you. I think I’ll take you up on that; I have some calls to make back to Ivrana. Take care.”

With the humans now aware of the real reason behind the Sivkit Grand Herd’s foray, it was my time to inform General Naltor that Loxsel accepted our offer. It would take quite a while to get back home, but it would all be worth it if it bolstered Bissems’ galactic standing. At least my ship wouldn’t be traveling alone on the trip back; perhaps the Sivkit passengers would be better conversation than the zany ambassador. Whatever Onso had said about how we hadn’t achieved our current status on our own, missions like this proved that the Yotul were wrong on that front. 

Bissems were more than capable of contributing to our own progress, carving out a role in the galaxy, and bringing about a successful future through our own fortitude. Being an uplift didn’t mean that we were useless, or that we wouldn’t show aliens the value we brought to the table.
