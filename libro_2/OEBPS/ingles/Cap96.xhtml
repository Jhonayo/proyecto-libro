Memory Transcription Subject: Adam Meier, Advisor to the Secretary-General

Date [standardized human time]: April 29, 2161

To say there was a great deal of opposition to the idea of reviving billions of citizens from five dead species was to state the obvious. Perhaps it was surprising that I would voice such an opinion, since I neither believed myself to be Elias nor thought it wise to revive people without their consent. However, it was when I came to realize I was my own person, someone that could carry on his legacy and his memories in a palpable way, that I saw the beauty in it. It was for each individual to decide whether they believed themselves to be the original, and to have an opportunity to contribute to a new life.

No organic chooses to be born either, when you think about it. I think I’ve found meaning in this life, that I’ve been able to accomplish more than I would’ve if Elias’ ideations were never passed on.

Onso scoffed. “How can you, of all people, suggest this? You thought it was wrong to bring you back, which went against your namesake’s fundamental wishes! You had no choice or say in the matter: very much the same issue with uplifts, which by their nature alter and rip away their very identity. Their right to self-determination.”

“Those civilians did not choose to be murdered either. Would you look grieving loved ones in the eyes and tell them that they should not be able to reinstate the people that meant so much to them?”

“What of the ones who’d think such technology to be an abomination, after the trauma of seeing the legion? What of the children who you’d have to alter to give them…any semblance of a true life?”

“There are exceptions to any rule; coming from a species who frolics within the loopholes, I would know. We need to investigate and litigate it all with immense caution, but I think it’s worthwhile to find an honorable path*.”* I glanced at Radai during those words. “Surely we must try in some way to breathe new life into the ashes, wherever we can.”

“I understand your bias, but that life should be biological,” Radai spoke up, earning stares—and ear flicks of agreement—from the Sapient Coalition representatives. “The honorable way is to take the long, difficult path, much like the ark humans. We can regrow and rebuild without transforming the nature of our civilization.”

“My proposed mission does not have to be done in a hurry either—it can be planned for as long as is necessary to get it right. Didn’t we, not too long ago, find it to be our mandate to return the Osirs to the galaxy? That was a cause we all could get behind, and it’s the biological life you mentioned Radai. How are the fallen souls, whom we have a direct opportunity to bring back any less innocent and deserved of aid? Of a true attempt at aid, not resignation to a gloomy future?”

“You are a fool if you think this is true aid. This would not return things to how they were. It would not be the society I wished to protect. Hear me, Adam: it would be radically different, to walk in the footsteps of the Underscales.” 

“Society is constantly changing and evolving—would your ancestors recognize Resket technology and society today? Stagnation is as much of a danger as unfettered progress, General Radai; the former was the downfall of the Federation and the Arxur alike, while the latter transgression led to the carnage brought by the Consortium.”

“We can circumvent this technology without remaining stagnant. I do not want to see my true people outshone and outlived by robots! Only the Trombil would entertain such a ludicrous notion.”

“You do not speak for everyone, just as I do not. My reaction to revival was entirely different to Kristin Haugstad, the young woman who was the second. I ask for this discussion to be undertaken, one which would source the opinions of the surviving Consortium refugees also. Let them have the option to determine the fate of their species, as a ‘true’ leader should.”

Secretary-General Osmani spoke up. “I think that assessing how the Consortium’s survivors would feel is essential, before we follow any mistakes of the Federation’s old uplift philosophy—as Onso mentioned. We should consider how the technology can be used to help. I can add this to a future SC meeting’s agenda. The process can be a case-by-case basis, even, hinging on whether loved ones who know them best would opt-in.”

Satisfied with getting the ball rolling on these discussions, and including the people involved in them, I turned my attention to that which would be a non-negotiable if I was still in the Secretary-General’s chair. The welfare of the vassal species at our disposal, with the hopes of deradicalizing the worst offenders, was my top concern. All sapients had to be permitted into the galaxy to have that better future, dreamed of by Elias Meier and Chief Hunter Isif not that long ago. I stared at Ambassador Raza standing in the crowd, encouraged that she hadn’t been driven out.

The Arxur Collective’s aid against the Consortium was to all of the Sapient Coalition species, which must’ve won them some brownie points despite Kaisal’s rash tactics. If the day comes where an Arxur and a Venlil child can share a classroom, then we will have succeeded in fixing the atrocious mess we walked into.

“The words I impart to you now will be the last you’ll hear from me, so I hope you’ll pay full heed to my farewell address. I have spoken in this very assemblage about the judgment and aspersions we have cast, as well as the punitive, exclusionary actions taken against past enemies. We must allow all species to rejoin us *as equals—*is that not what the Universal Declaration of Sapient Rights means?”

“What are you saying? We let the Bissems—*carnivores—*join at your behest, and that wasn’t enough?” Mazic President Quipa trumpeted.

“Equality applies to all. Humanity forgave our past enemies and gave you the chance to atone, write a new chapter; Harchen, Tilfish, and Krakotl work alongside us in spite of attacking Earth. Meting out forgiveness is not easy, but it's the only way past demons will not haunt us until the end of time. It’s the only way we can heal. It’s time to allow the Arxur, Kolshians, and Farsul to participate in the galaxy.”

Secretary-General Osmani looked surprised that I was going there, but quickly leapt up in my defense. “The Kolshian and Farsul civilians have been imprisoned for the species they were born as. They cannot change it, just as we couldn’t remove our binocular eyes. I want us to be better than the Federation. I want us not to use their actions to justify our own.”

“The Arxur played a major role in liberating the galaxy in both wars, and have arguably changed more than the Federation,” Governor Laisa remarked. “The Venlil believe it is time to…see them as people. As ghastly as their crimes were, as many lives as they ruined, they fought back against their ideology. Without mass starvation, they have a solution other than…chowing down on Venlil.”

Ambassador Raza spoke up, her forward-facing eyes shining. “I assure you that I am horrified by even imagining what we have done, and could never bring myself to consider the Venlil in that way. The new generation of Arxur are different, and played no part in the reprehensible policies of Betterment. I despise all that they stood for. I want only to work alongside you as friends.”

“The Duerten have never forgotten how you saved Kalqua. The Shield have not,” Korajan piped up. “I hope the Sapient Coalition will consider the lives the new Arxur faction, who replaced those monsters, have saved. They align with your cause more often than not.”

“That’s an excellent recollection, my Duerten friend.” I smiled toward the gray avian, and mused to myself how that simple expression would’ve had representatives running for the hills back in the old days. Now, no one even cared. “I implore the Sapient Coalition to permit the entry of all who wish to join us on our mission to foster peace and cooperation. The Shield shares that mission whole-heartedly, though they wish to remain a separate entity—a fact humanity respects, since we are neither the conquerors nor the domineers that the Federation declared us to be. I hope we can forge a tight alliance outside of war.”

Leshee Ambassador Yali spoke up. “You have our support, though we are proud members of both polities. Perhaps others in the Shield will follow suit. After seeing who was controlling the ghost Farsul and remembering…what they did to us all, we could drift closer to your side.”

“Humans put them down with an unparalleled ferociousness; you are terrifying when your entire species focused on a single goal,” Harchen representative Nahley said. 

“It wasn’t just us,” Osmani countered. “We are a terrifying force when we’re true to our mission, and the entire galaxy bands together. We must not forget where our strength lies. We lost it somewhere along the way before, but I aim to stoke that fire and keep it alight. Our true golden era of prosperity is yet to come.”

I nodded. “Prosperity for all. I am adamant on that regard. The Kolshians and the Farsul must not languish in obscurity for past sins, and the Federation—we must rehabilitate them. We must correct and re-teach them the truth about us, just like we did for many of you.”

Zurulian Ambassador Chauson perked his ears up. “The exchange programs taught us who humanity really were, and stripped away the terrifying fright they once projected. I think the only way to change the Remnants is through patience and exposure. It’s not a hopeless cause. Today, we’ve seen Bissems, Farsul, and Sivkits living on the same world. It’s a sight that fills my old bones with joy.”

“Mine as well. We are so close to moving on, and what a powerful statement that would be to those who wished to divide and drag us back. I hope we can avoid the pitfall we made in the last war, which has caused pain and suffering for innocent people. I beg all of you to show mercy and compassion for the Consortium civilians, rather than condemning them for the government that would have killed them all to prove a point.” 

“They never had a chance,” Radai commented bleakly. “In the end, we were all expendable. Please do not treat us as such. I believe I speak for the KC that…we need your help to start over, regardless of if we follow Adam’s plan. I can only fall on my shredded reputation and beg you to let us join the Sapient Coalition. The people admired you so much, whatever their governments did.”

Laisa gave a playful tail swish. “Admired is certainly a word for the interest spike. The tourism profits alone should encourage Earth to move the Krev right in.”

“Forgive me if I’m not in a joking mood. I’ve seen the loss of everything I ever cared about or believed in. All I have left is the hope that you’ll be…better, somewhere through my shattered faith and despair. The Jaslips have already expressed their wish to join you; they were mistreated for far too long. Bring them in and give them the equality they deserve, if you look kindly on no one else.”

“The Sapient Coalition was and is already helping the Jaslips; I see no reason we’d stop now. I can promise to you that I intend to help all of the species the Consortium’s final spite left behind.” Secretary-General Osmani cleared his throat, with an expectant arch of his eyebrows. “Adam has raised some excellent points which could set the tone for where our priorities lie. I’d like to thank him for all that he’s done on behalf of humanity, and for his unrelenting fighting spirit on the issues of our time.”

“Ah, that’s my cue, isn’t it? I’m only a man for following his convictions, who asks others to do the same. My hopes for this organization remain high. We can achieve much more than we imagine we can. We just have to not get in our own way, and to choose our better instincts.” Emotions threatened to choke me up, even without the ability to cry or have a constricted throat. I’d said almost all that I wished to declare to the watching eyes. It felt strange to be saying goodbye to this life and this career: as if I was laying Elias to rest all the way. “Goodbye, my dear friends. Serving you has been the honor of two lifetimes.”

A distinctly Terran standing ovation was led by the United Nations diplomats, which the other Sapient Coalition representatives followed suit to the best of their biological ability. I wasn’t sure if they were clapping for Elias Meier, the storied icon of peace that had become a martyr through death, or Adam Meier, the first of his kind synthetic human who reminded his species who they were supposed to be. In my heart, it didn’t matter. I waved goodbye to the gathered assembly with fondness, hoping that I was walking away during the prelude to human history’s soon-to-come greatest chapter.
